# COFFEE - MANAGEMENT

With this project you can manage the coffee cans in different building on a variety of floors.
To do this, a server is operated on a Raspberry Pi, which triggers the RFID chips and manage
and execute different actions. The server interacts with the client and conversely with a plug-in.
This plug-in provides several user notifications for the information, a progressbar which tracks 
the brewing status of the coffee pot. Important user data is stored in a database in order to 
provide info monitoting. These info monitoring is availabe on a website which is operated by
a NGINX server and an angular application.


For more information and a detailed discription of the code please read the "Kaffeeverwaltung"
document. Note: So far only a german version exists.
